I gave a talk and a poster presentation on [Geometric Deep Learning](http://geometricdeeplearning.com) and its use for accelating molecular dynamics simulations of nonthermal plasma at the [2024 Dusty Plasma Workshop](https://dpw2024.umn.edu) in Minneapolis, MN.
The abstract can be seen [here](https://dpw2024.umn.edu/sites/dpw2024.umn.edu/files/2024-03/angela_violi_machine_learning_models_for_nanoparticle_growth_in_nonthermal_plasma.pdf).
