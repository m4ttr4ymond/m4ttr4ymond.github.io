I recently gave a talk about prediction nanoscale interactions using Machine Learning for the [UMich Tools and Technology seminar](https://medschool.umich.edu/events/tools-technology-seminar-series).
A recording should be available [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjvLXvfPupVHtGU_ckTDPwA/videos) eventually.
Many thanks to my co-authors [Jacob Saldinger](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hEtp2e8AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Paolo Elvati](https://violilab.github.io/people/elvati/), and to my advisor [Angela Violi](https://violilab.github.io/people/avioli/) for their help with this paper!
