I have just received the [2024-2025 J. Robert Beyster Computational Innovation Graduate Fellowship](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/stories/matt-raymond-receives-beyster-fellowship-to-support-research-on-nanoscale-particle-design) for my work in machine learning in computational chemistry, with applications in nanomedicine.
This fellowship covers one year of tuition, stipend, and health insurance.
Many thanks to my advisors [Angela Violi](https://violilab.github.io/people/avioli/) and [Clayton Scott](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~cscott/), and to [Paolo Elvati](https://violilab.github.io/people/elvati/) for their support and guidance!
