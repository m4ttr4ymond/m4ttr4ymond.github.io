## Elementary School

### [Joel David Hamkins: Math for Kids [Blog]](http://jdh.hamkins.org/category/math-for-kids/)

Academic Bio:

> My main research interest lies in mathematical and philosophical logic, particularly set theory, with a focus on the mathematics and philosophy of the infinite. I have worked particularly with forcing and large cardinals, those strong axioms of infinity, and have investigated the interaction of these two central set-theoretic concepts.  I have worked in the theory of infinitary computability, introducing (with A. Lewis and J. Kidder) the theory of infinite time Turing machines, as well as in the theory of infinitary utilitarianism and, more recently, infinite chess.  My work on the automorphism tower problem lies at the intersection of group theory and set theory.  Recently, I am preoccupied with various mathematical and philosophical issues surrounding the set-theoretic multiverse, engaging with the emerging debate on pluralism in the philosophy of set theory, as well as the mathematical questions to which they lead, such as my work on the modal logic of forcing and set-theoretic geology.

### [Discovering Category Theory with primary school children](http://danghica.blogspot.com/2019/09/discovering-category-theory-with.html)

> A few years ago I ran a maths circle for primary school children experimenting with teaching category theory. The meetings were documented in a series of blog posts which were recently published as a series of articles by Mathematics Teaching, the journal of the Association of Teachers of Mathematics (issues 264-268).

## Middle School
### [Graph Theory for the Middle School](https://dc.etsu.edu/etd/2226)
*Laura Ann Robinson, MSc Thesis, '06*
> After being introduced to graph theory and realizing how it can be utilized to solve real-world problems, the author decided to create modules of study on graph theory appropriate for middle school students. In this thesis, four modules were developed in the area of graph theory: an Introduction to Terms and Definitions, Graph Families, Graph Operations, and Graph Coloring. It is written as a guide for middle school teachers to prepare teaching units on graph theory.


## High School
