My research is at the intersection of Machine Learning (ML) theory and Biochemistry applications. Currently, I'm interested in developing generalized frameworks for ML in chemistry, which has applications in drug discovery, the prediction of macromolecular interactions, and exploration of biochemical chemical reactions.

I received my [BSc in Computer Science](https://www.chapman.edu/engineering/academic-programs/bs-computer-science.aspx) ('22, Magna Cum Laude) from Chapman University and will be receiving my [MSc in Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/academics/graduate/masters-in-cse/) from the University of Michigan (Spring '22). I will be starting a [PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/academics/graduate-programs/prospective-grad-students/about-the-doctoral-program/) at the University of Michigan in Fall '22, specializing in Signal and Image Processing and Machine Learning.
