	abstract={Tree ensembles achieve state-of-the-art performance despite being greedily optimized. Global refinement (GR) reduces greediness by jointly and globally optimizing all constant leaves. We propose Joint Optimization of Piecewise Linear ENsembles (JOPLEN), a piecewise-linear extension of GR. Compared to GR, JOPLEN improves model flexibility and can apply common penalties, including sparsity-promoting matrix norms and subspace-norms, to nonlinear prediction. We evaluate the Frobenius norm, â„“2,1 norm, and Laplacian regularization for 146 regression and classification datasets; JOPLEN, combined with GB trees and RF, achieves superior performance in both settings. Additionally, JOPLEN with a nuclear norm penalty empirically learns smooth and subspace-aligned functions. Finally, we perform multitask feature selection by extending the Dirty LASSO. JOPLEN Dirty LASSO achieves a superior feature sparsity/performance tradeoff to linear and gradient boosted approaches. We anticipate that JOPLEN will improve regression, classification, and feature selection across many fields.},

	title = {Universal Feature Selection for Simultaneous Interpretability of Multitask Datasets},
	year = {2024},
	abstract={Extracting meaningful features from complex, high-dimensional datasets across scientific domains remains challenging. Current methods often struggle with scalability, limiting their applicability to large datasets, or make restrictive assumptions about feature-property relationships, hindering their ability to capture complex interactions. BoUTS's general and scalable feature selection algorithm surpasses these limitations to identify both universal features relevant to all datasets and task-specific features predictive for specific subsets. Evaluated on seven diverse chemical regression datasets, BoUTS achieves state-of-the-art feature sparsity while maintaining prediction accuracy comparable to specialized methods. Notably, BoUTS's universal features enable domain-specific knowledge transfer between datasets, and suggest deep connections in seemingly-disparate chemical datasets. We expect these results to have important repercussions in manually-guided inverse problems. Beyond its current application, BoUTS holds immense potential for elucidating data-poor systems by leveraging information from similar data-rich systems. BoUTS represents a significant leap in cross-domain feature selection, potentially leading to advancements in various scientific fields.},

	abstract = {The accurate and rapid prediction of generic nanoscale interactions is a challenging problem with broad applications. Much of biology functions at the nanoscale, and our ability to manipulate materials and engage biological machinery in a purposeful manner requires knowledge of nano-bio interfaces. While several protein-protein interaction models are available, they leverage protein-specific information, limiting their abstraction to other structures. Here, we present NeCLAS, a general, and rapid machine learning pipeline that predicts the location of nanoscale interactions, providing human-intelligible predictions. Two key aspects distinguish NeCLAS: coarsegrained representations, and the use of environmental features to encode the chemical neigh-borhood. We showcase NeCLAS with challenges for protein-protein, protein-nanoparticle and nanoparticle-nanoparticle systems, demonstrating that NeCLAS replicates computationally- and experimentally-observed interactions. NeCLAS outperforms current nanoscale prediction models and it shows cross-domain validity. We anticipate that our framework will contribute to both basic research and rapid prototyping and design of diverse nanostructures in nanobiotechnology.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract={Although challenging, the accurate and rapid prediction of nanoscale interactions has broad applications for numerous biological processes and material properties. While several models have been developed to predict the interaction of specific biological components, they use system-specific information that hinders their application to more general materials. Here we present NeCLAS, a general and efficient machine learning pipeline that predicts the location of nanoscale interactions, providing human-intelligible predictions. NeCLAS outperforms current nanoscale prediction models for generic nanoparticles up to 10--20{\thinspace}nm, reproducing interactions for biological and non-biological systems. Two aspects contribute to these results: a low-dimensional representation of nanoparticles and molecules (to reduce the effect of data uncertainty), and environmental features (to encode the physicochemical neighborhood at multiple scales).
