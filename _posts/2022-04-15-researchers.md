title: Researchers of Note
date: 2023-05-15
description: An abridged list of researchers that I've found during my literature reviews
---

*Note: This is a list of researchers that I wanted to keep track of, and I thought it would be useful for others to make it public.*
*This list is certainly not comprehensive, and will certainly grow over time.*
*Inclusion/exclusion of researchers on/from this list should not be considered a value judgement.*
*Names are arranged in canonical ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ order.*

*If you feel strongly that a certain researchers should be included in this list, feel free to contact me and I may add them.*
*Also, please let me know if any of these links break.*
