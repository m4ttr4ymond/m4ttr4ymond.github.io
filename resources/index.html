From what I’ve seen so far, I really like this book. It focuses on the manifolds that are often found “in the wild,” and it seems to provide a reasonable amount of intuition when explaining new concepts. I think that it would be more efficient to read this book before <em>Manifolds and Differential Geometry</em>, as this book provides more help to the reader than the latter does.</p> <h3 id="manifolds-and-differential-geometry"><a href="https://bookstore.ams.org/gsm-107" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Manifolds and Differential Geometry</a></h3> <p>I also started this book recently, but I really like the way that Lee writes. This book seems to be very rigorous, and spends a lot of time setting up the notation required for theorems. I think that this book goes well with “Topology Without Tears,” and it looks like you will know enough topology for “Manifolds” if you get about halfway through “Topology.” Unfortunately, this one is not free unless your organization subscribes to the AMS library.</p> <h3 id="topology-without-tears"><a href="https://www.topologywithouttears.net/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Topology Without Tears</a></h3> <p>I’ve only started this book recently, but it has very intuitive explanations and many exercises. I wouldn’t call it a “hardcore” topology book, but it’s definitely helpful for picking up some topology on the side. It also comes with several associated lectures, which are available trough YouTube links on the site. Overall, I think it’s a very enjoyable read.</p> <h3 id="gaussian-processes-for-machine-learning"><a href="http://gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning</a></h3> <p>This book gives a good introduction to Gaussian Processes. I found it to be very helpful.</p> <blockquote> <p>Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a principled, practical, probabilistic approach to learning in kernel machines. GPs have received increased attention in the machine-learning community over the past decade, and this book provides a long-needed systematic and unified treatment of theoretical and practical aspects of GPs in machine learning. The treatment is comprehensive and self-contained, targeted at researchers and students in machine learning and applied statistics.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The book deals with the supervised-learning problem for both regression and classification, and includes detailed algorithms. A wide variety of covariance (kernel) functions are presented and their properties discussed. Model selection is discussed both from a Bayesian and a classical perspective. Many connections to other well-known techniques from machine learning and statistics are discussed, including support-vector machines, neural networks, splines, regularization networks, relevance vector machines and others. Theoretical issues including learning curves and the PAC-Bayesian framework are treated, and several approximation methods for learning with large datasets are discussed. The book contains illustrative examples and exercises, and code and datasets are available on the Web.<br> Appendixes provide mathematical background and a discussion of Gaussian Markov processes.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="geometric-deep-learning-grids-groups-graphs-geodesics-and-gauges"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13478" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Geometric Deep Learning: Grids, Groups, Graphs, Geodesics, and Gauges</a></h3> <p>To me, this seems like the definitive work on Geometric Deep Learning. There’s more than enough material to warrant several readings.</p> <blockquote> <p>The last decade has witnessed an experimental revolution in data science and machine learning, epitomized by deep learning methods. Indeed, many high-dimensional learning tasks previously thought to be beyond reach – such as computer vision, playing Go, or protein folding – are in fact feasible with appropriate computational scale. Remarkably, the essence of deep learning is built from two simple algorithmic principles: first, the notion of representation or feature learning, whereby adapted, often hierarchical, features capture the appropriate notion of regularity for each task, and second, learning by local gradient-descent type methods, typically implemented as backpropagation.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>While learning generic functions in high dimensions is a cursed estimation problem, most tasks of interest are not generic, and come with essential pre-defined regularities arising from the underlying low-dimensionality and structure of the physical world. This text is concerned with exposing these regularities through unified geometric principles that can be applied throughout a wide spectrum of applications. Such a ‘geometric unification’ endeavour, in the spirit of Felix Klein’s Erlangen Program, serves a dual purpose: on one hand, it provides a common mathematical framework to study the most successful neural network architectures, such as CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers. On the other hand, it gives a constructive procedure to incorporate prior physical knowledge into neural architectures and provide principled way to build future architectures yet to be invented.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="blogs">Blogs</h2> <h3 id="math3ma"><a href="https://www.math3ma.com" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Math3ma</a></h3> <p>Tai-Danae Bradley is a research mathematician at Alphabet.
